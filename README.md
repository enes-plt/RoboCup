# RoboCup
The RoboCup in the context of these project is an international initiative promoting research in artificial intelligence and robotics through competitive challenges, specifically robot soccer matches.
The primary aim is for robots to autonomously decide and execute strategies, especially in competitive sports scenarios like soccer.

In these project, designing logic for robots to evaluate their position, pass to teammates, or attempt to score goals are implemented.
Involves defining Prolog rules that allow a robot to reason about its ability to score, calculate optimal paths, and make decisions on passing or shooting.
